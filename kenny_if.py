-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




- Dictionary Methods -
A. Create a nested dictionary. Get any inner value using multiple key-indexing. 

nested_dict = {
    "person": {
        "name": "Kanan",
        "detail": {
            "age": 30,
            "address": {
                "city": "Baku",
                "zipcode": "1089"
            }
        }
    }
}

city = nested_dict["person"]["detail"]["address"]["city"]
print(f"The city is: {city}")



B. Create a dictionary with your personal data (name, surname, age, family status,
gender). Ask user for any key in your dictionary. Print the value of the given
key from the dictionary. Try to ask all keys. 


personal_data = {
    "name": "Kanan",
    "surname": "Babayev
    "age": 32,
    "family_status": "Single",
    "gender": "Male"
}

key = input("Enter a key (name, surname, age, family_status, gender): ").strip().lower()
if key in personal_data:
    print(f"The value for '{key}' is: {personal_data[key]}")
else:
    print(f"Key '{key}' not found in personal data.")



C. Create a dictionary with stock data of clothes (cloth name + amount). Let 
the user choose any of keys and add some count to it. 

clothes = {
    "shirt": 10,
    "pants": 5,
    "jacket": 2,
    "socks": 20
}
new_clothes = input("Add new clothes: ").strip().lower()
count_clothes = int(input("Add new clothes: "))
clothes[new_clothes] = count_clothes
print(clothes)


D. Copy any dictionary from previous tasks. Print it. 

copy_clothes = clothes.copy()

print(copy_clothes)

E. Clear the dictionary from Task D. Print the length of this dictionary.

clothes.clear()
print(len(clothes))

F. Create an empty dictionary. Let the user add data to it (key & value). Choose
any topic (books, cars, info, items, grades...) and let the user fill it with
minimum 4 key-value pairs. 
data = {}
for _ in range(4):
    key = input("Enter key: ")
    value = input("Enter value: ")
    data[key] = value
print(data)


G. You have the following dictionary: 
car = {
    "brand": "Chevrolet",
    "model": "Camaro",
    "year": 2017
}
not_found_message = "Value not found"

year = car.get("year", not_found_message)
color = car.get("color", not_found_message)

print(f"Year: {year}")
print(f"Color: {color}")

Create a 'not_found_message' variable. Make it equal appropriate "not found" message.
Try to get 'year's and 'color's values from the 'car'. Set the default value to 
our "not found" message.     



H. Print the first 6 keys from the following dictionary (hint: you should use 
'list()' method to convert dict_keys to list and indexing to get the appropriate

countries_capitals = {
    "USA": "Washington, D.C.",
    "Canada": "Ottawa",
    "United Kingdom": "London",
    "France": "Paris",
    "Germany": "Berlin",
    "Japan": "Tokyo",
    "Australia": "Canberra",
    "Brazil": "Bras√≠lia",
    "India": "New Delhi",
    "South Africa": "Pretoria",
}

first_six_dict = list(countries_capitals.keys())
print(first_six_dict[:6])


I. You have the following dictionary:
programming_languages = {
    "Python": {
        "designed_by": "Guido van Rossum",
        "first_appeared": 1991,
        "paradigm": "Multi-paradigm",
        "typing": "Dynamic",
        "popularity": "High"
    },
    "JavaScript": {
        "designed_by": "Brendan Eich",
        "first_appeared": 1995,
        "paradigm": "Multi-paradigm",
        "typing": "Dynamic",
        "popularity": "Very High"
    },
    "Java": {
        "designed_by": "James Gosling",
        "first_appeared": 1995,
        "paradigm": "Object-oriented",
        "typing": "Static",
        "popularity": "High"
    },
    "C++": {
        "designed_by": "Bjarne Stroustrup",
        "first_appeared": 1985,
        "paradigm": "Multi-paradigm",
        "typing": "Static",
        "popularity": "Moderate"
    }
}

Using in f-strings print the year Python was appeared value.


python = programming_languages["Python"]
print(f"Python first appeared in {python["first_appeared"]}")

J. You have the following code snippet:
tasks = {
    "Alice": ["Buy groceries", "Finish report", "Call the doctor"],
    "Bob": ["Walk the dog", "Pay bills", "Read a chapter"]
}

selected_person = "Alice"
new_task = "Go to the gym"

up_task = tasks["Alice"].append("Go to the gym")

print(tasks)

Add the new task to the selected person's tasks. Print the tasks & length of tasks 
before and after edition.





K. There is a dictionary method that helps to create a dictionary with a collection
of keys and apply a default value to that key. Using that method create a dictionary
with all values equal to the '[0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20]' list and keys should only be
the numbers from 0 to 4, so your dictionary should look like: 
digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

my_dict = {
    0: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
    1: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
    2: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
    3: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
    4: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
}

You should use list comprehension in this task. 

Then you should print some portion from the list values of a dictionary. The
portion size depends on a key you are using to index the list. 



L. Print all items, values, keys from 'programming_languages' dictionary.

programming_languages = {
    "Python": {
        "designed_by": "Guido van Rossum",
        "first_appeared": 1991,
        "paradigm": "Multi-paradigm",
        "typing": "Dynamic",
        "popularity": "High"
    },
    "JavaScript": {
        "designed_by": "Brendan Eich",
        "first_appeared": 1995,
        "paradigm": "Multi-paradigm",
        "typing": "Dynamic",
        "popularity": "Very High"
    },
    "Java": {
        "designed_by": "James Gosling",
        "first_appeared": 1995,
        "paradigm": "Object-oriented",
        "typing": "Static",
        "popularity": "High"
    },
    "C++": {
        "designed_by": "Bjarne Stroustrup",
        "first_appeared": 1985,
        "paradigm": "Multi-paradigm",
        "typing": "Static",
        "popularity": "Moderate"
    }
}
print("Values:", programming_languages.values())
print("Keys:", programming_languages.keys())


M. Remove 'Java' from 'programming_languages' dictionary & get its value. Print it. 
java_remove = programming_languages.pop("Java")

print(programming_languages)
print("Java:", java_remove)


N. Remove the last item from the following dictionary and print it:
car = {
    "brand": "Ford",
    "model": "Mustang",
    "year": 1964
}

car.popitem()
print(car)


O. Expand 'programming_languages' dictionary with the following data:
language_to_add = {
    "PHP": {
        "designed_by": "Rasmus Lerdorf",
        "first_appeared": 1995,
        "paradigm": "Server-side scripting",
        "typing": "Dynamic",
        "popularity": "Moderate"
    }
}
programming_languages.update(language_to_add)
print(programming_languages)





P. Use 'setdefault' method on any dictionary. 
car = {
    "brand": "Ford",
    "model": "Mustang",
    "year": 1964
}

car.setdefault("color", "red")
print(car)


Q. Which Data Types can be represented as values of any dictionary?
R. In the following example: 
data = {
    "Python3.x": {
        "Wep Development", "Machine Learning", "Penetration Testing", "Game Development"
    }
} 
edit_error = data.get("Python2.x", "Key not found")
print(edit_error)

It's giving an error if you try to get 'Python2.x' in this way:
data["Python2.x"]
Edit this code so it doesn't return an error.
